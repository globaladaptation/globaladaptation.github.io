          <p class="text-white-50">This initiative aims to systematically review global literature providing evidence of documented/observed adaptation actions that can directly reduce risk or vulnerability to climate change.<br>
            <br>
The Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative came to life via numerous discussions among several adaptation researchers in the context of the IPCC Assessment Report 6 process. Many of us felt that adaptation had not received sufficient prominence in key parts of previous assessment reports, and that there was a particular lack of evidence synthesis of adaptation insights. We realized that there was a growing desire for more systematic synthesis of adaptation literature to bring together diverse insights and answer the 'big' question(s): Are we adapting?<br>
            <br>
While there is a well-established tradition of including global maps summarizing climate impacts within IPCC assessments, there has to-date been negligible inclusion of prominent figures or maps of adaptation progress in key documents (e.g. synthesis report, summary for policy makers). Yet these graphics are often pointed to as key outputs used by governments, researchers, and organizations globally. Recognizing that there was not sufficient capacity within the IPCC assessment process to undertake this type of synthesis work, we came up with the ridiculous idea of mobilizing an initiative to synthesize global adaptation research independently and without funding, and to get this work done before the IPCC AR6 publication deadline in mid-2020.<br>
            <br>
And so this initiative was born! And thanks to a huge team of experts contributing to the development of the initiative, and to screening and coding, and many other tasks, the initiative is moving forward and on-time.

          <p class="text-white-50">We have all conducted a literature review or other form of evidence synthesis in our careers. Have you conducted a literature review but were concerned you might have missed something? Do you want reliable evidence but worry that existing reviews might not be rigorous enough? Do you want to conduct reviews in the most rigorous way possible, being comprehensive and transparent, and minimising bias? That is where systematic reviews come in!<br>
          <br>
With growing recognition of the inevitability of climate change, adaptation has become a core element of climate policy and research. Yet, our knowledge of how human systems will adapt to climate change remains limited. The physical basis of climate change, though complex, can be evaluated vis a vis greenhouse gas emissions. Evaluating and understanding climate change adaptation is conceptually murkier, and the need for comprehensive syntheses of existing research and tools to evaluate progress on adaptation is increasingly needed. Criticism of existing IPCC assessment reports have called for research synthesis methods that are transparent, clearly deﬁned, and limit reviewer/author bias. Though such debates have been primarily targeted at the physical basis of climate change, the adaptation literature is arguably in greater need of systematic synthesis of existing knowledge if we are to document if adaptation is taking place and respond to areas of highest impact and/or vulnerability, evaluate whether adaptation support is translating into actions, facilitate comparison of adaptations across regions and sectors, ensure resources are being appropriately invested, and inform governance systems on the current status and gaps in adaptation action. Systematic review approaches provide a conceptually appropriate and practical opportunity for increasing methodological transparency and rigor in synthesizing and tracking adaptation research.<br>
          <br>
The Paris Agreement and Katowice Climate Package articulated a clear mandate to document and assess adaptation progress towards the Global Goal on Adaptation. This includes regularly scheduled stocktaking exercises to summarize and synthesise progress on adaptation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports provide an important forum for synthesizing research and evidence to inform the adaptation stocktake. Yet to-date there has been negligible/little robust, systematic synthesis of progress on adaptation or adaptation-relevant responses across the globe. The purpose of this review is thus to systematically map and review human adaptation responses to climate-related changes that have been documented globally since 2013, primarily in the scientific and grey literature, but also — where possible — through synthesis of Indigenous and local knowledge sources. The broad question underpinning this review is: Are we adapting to climate change? More specifically, we ask ‘what is the evidence relating to human adaptation-relevant responses that can (or are) directly reducing risk, exposure, and/or vulnerability to climate change?’ We will review scientific and grey literature since 2013 using a range of bibliographic databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar to identify documents empirically reporting on adaptation-related responses to climate change in human systems. We exclude non-empirical (theoretical & conceptual) literature and autonomous/ evolutionary adaptation in natural systems. We will then identify a subset of these documents that report on observed responses that can directly reduce risk/exposure/vulnerability (excluding planning, policies, vulnerability assessment, adaptation strategies). This subset will comprise our included documents for coding across a set of questions focused on: Who is responding? What responses are documented? What is the extent of the adaptation-related response? Are adaptation-related responses reported to reduce risk, exposure and/or vulnerability? We will supplement this systematic mapping with an expert elicitation exercise, undertaken to synthesize insights from included/coded literature for global regions and sectors, with associated synthesis statements and confidence assessments. The primary output will be a series of global maps of adaptation based on our review questions, with key insights and confidence levels.
